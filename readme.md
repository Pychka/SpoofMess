# SpoofMess

## What is it?
    A cross-platform messenger with any type of chats, stickers/emoji - that's just a dream for now.

## What stage of the project at?
    While on Alpha 0.0.1. Realized first prototypes of:
        - Microservice of entrance(SpoofEntranceService);
        - Data services(db, cache, cached-aside repository);
        - Logger service(file logger);
        - Hash passwords and keys.

    Now this is a simply example only for test entrance functions
